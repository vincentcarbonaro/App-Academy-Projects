The New York-based series features a woman, played by Ellie Kemper from \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Office\\u003C/em\\u003E, who is rescued after spending 15 years underground in an Indiana doomsday cult and decides to start her life over. It’s also great news for Kemper and company, since now \\u003Cem\\u003EKimmy Schmidt\\u003C/em\\u003E will debut its entire 13-episode first season to Netflix subscribers on Friday, Mar. 6.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs Netflix continues to change the way viewers watch TV, in the process evolving from a niche outlet to one that \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/301518/forget-beating-hbo-netflix-just-revealed-it-has-much-bigger-goals-in-mind/\\\"\\u003Ewants to be all things to all people\\u003C/a\\u003E, the streaming service has also done something unexpected: it’s helping to save the network sitcom.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETo be fair, NBC is not the only network struggling to make viewers laugh.

It’s partly a timing issue. Most sitcoms need the better part of a season to hone their comedic voice and tailor the show to the strengths of its actors. Very few comedies (\\u003Cem\\u003EModern Family\\u003C/em\\u003E being a notable exception) are finely calibrated right out of the box, and many of the best recent long-running sitcoms—\\u003Cem\\u003EThe Office\\u003C/em\\u003E, \\u003Cem\\u003EParks and Recreation\\u003C/em\\u003E and Fey’s first hit \\u003Cem\\u003E30 Rock\\u003C/em\\u003E—had rocky, if not downright awful, first seasons.

Audiences—and networks—are abandoning most new network sitcoms quickly, sometimes after only an episode or two. And unless they have the benefit of another hit show as a lead-in to entice in audiences the way the terrific \\u003Cem\\u003EBlack-ish\\u003C/em\\u003E and \\u003Cem\\u003EFresh Off the Boat\\u003C/em\\u003E did this season with the help of \\u003Cem\\u003EModern Family\\u003C/em\\u003E, they’re often doomed before they even begin. As Kimmy, Kemper’s bubbly enthusiasm is infectious (“I’m having candy for dinner!”), and the series, like Fey’s \\u003Cem\\u003E30 Rock\\u003C/em\\u003E before it, is packed with brilliant throwaway lines and Easter eggs. Still, even this promising upstart will need plenty of TLC to thrive.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat’s where Netflix gets to swoop in and play the hero. Its binge-loving audience gravitates toward serialized dramas like \\u003Cem\\u003EBreaking Bad\\u003C/em\\u003E, but as \\u003Cem\\u003EUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\\u003C/em\\u003E proves, bingeing can also be an ideal method for comedies.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFirst off, Netflix offers the guarantee of a full season. Even as sitcoms like \\u003Cem\\u003ESelfie\\u003C/em\\u003E improved creatively, the network’s writing was already on the wall. With ratings are that low, there’s little chance of a renewal, and therefore no incentive for viewers to become attached. With \\u003Cem\\u003EKimmy Schmidt\\u003C/em\\u003E, there are no such concerns. Not only can you be sure that all 13 episodes will air (and that a second season will arrive in 2016), but you can watch them all in one sitting if you’d like.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd while \\u003Cem\\u003EKimmy Schmidt\\u003C/em\\u003E episodes might not end with a traditional cliffhanger designed to carry you over to the next episode, like Netflix’s dramas ordinarily do, the show boasts plenty of comedic momentum. Out of the first six episodes I’ve seen, each ones gets stronger and stronger, as Fey and co-creator Robert Carlock build out their world and slowly layer in more laughs. The fourth episode is by far the funniest, packed with uproarious pop culture riffs and a disturbing yet riveting turn from guest star Martin Short. In a normal broadcast environment, many viewers would have thrown in the towel long before that point.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EArguably the biggest winner in the show’s migration to Netflix—besides the audience—is NBCUniversal itself, whose in-house studio Universal Television will produce \\u003Cem\\u003EUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\\u003C/em\\u003E. Now, instead of a short-lived tenure under NBC, the studio has a contract for at least two seasons of the show, and potentially many more.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“It really represents an interesting turning point in the TV business in a way,” Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos told Quartz earlier this year. “You’ve got a company that had a vested interest in the show being successful, NBC, but a deeper investment in the show being successful because they also produce the show and own the show. So they came to the conclusion that the show’s best chance of success would be to be on Netflix. That was a pretty big milestone in the way TV is made and produced and distributed. And we agree, that the show’s best chance of success is to be on Netflix.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs comedies have failed left and right this season across the networks, the importance of having an established, hit show to help launch a fledgling sitcom has become more and more apparent. Netflix is in the enviable position where the outlet itself \\u003Ci\\u003Eis\\u003C/i\\u003E the hit show. Drafting off the strength of \\u003Cem\\u003EOrange is the New Black\\u003C/em\\u003E and \\u003Cem\\u003EHouse of Cards\\u003C/em\\u003E, every new Netflix Original Series is seen as an event (though that might change after a few more clunkers like \\u003Cem\\u003EMarco Polo\\u003C/em\\u003E, renewed for a second season despite being terrible), which will give \\u003Cem\\u003EKimmy Schmidt\\u003C/em\\u003E more attention out of the gate than it would have ever received on NBC. And once viewers start binge-watching the show, the habit may become—like Kimmy Schmidt herself—unbreakable.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=356219\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/356219/netflixs-newest-debut-proves-it-might-be-the-modern-sitcoms-last-hope/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-03-05T07:00:49-05:00\",\"category\":\"Glass\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=356219\",\"dc_creator\":\"Jason Lynch\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/unbre_s1_004_h-e1425508608776.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/unbre_s1_004_h-e1425508608776.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/356219/netflixs-newest-debut-proves-it-might-be-the-modern-sitcoms-last-hope/"], ["published_at", Thu, 05 Mar 2015 12:00:49 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Netflix&#8217;s newest debut proves it might be the modern sitcom&#8217;s last hope"], ["updated_at", Thu, 05 Mar 2015 14:05:08 UTC +00:00]]

Once the state government issues a formal notification about the new amendment, the act will impose a blanket ban on the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and calves, in addition to cows (whose slaughter has been banned since 1976). Even the mere possession of their meat will then be punishable by a fine of Rs10,000 ($160) or five years in prison.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe only kind of cattle spared from the ban is the water buffalo, which many Mumbai residents have been getting on their plates for years.

It worries about healthcare, casework decision making, the quality of legal advice, access to the internet and the architectural design of the buildings, while calling for more and better alternatives to confinement. It differs slightly from other publications by settling on a figure for the time limit (28 days), and in the attention it pays to female victims of rape and sexual abuse (although not male victims of the same) as well as LBGTI detainees. The former, the report argues, should not be detained at all, the latter need more careful care than they currently receive\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe report pulls back from, or perhaps never intended on, advocating the abolition of detention. As a result, many of its recommendations fall rather flat, since, as the authors recognize, they already fit into current guidelines. Thus, the various populations whom the report urges should only be detained under ‘exceptional’ circumstances are, for the most part, already subject to similar restrictions, albeit ones that for some of them aren’t met.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003E80% of those we surveyed in detention are clinically depressed.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EPresumably the decision to adopt the language of ‘exception’ rather than of abolition reflects a political horizon. It may well be that closing immigration removal centers down is unfeasible, while reducing them is more realistic. Or maybe the committee is playing a long game. For instance, one of the committee’s recommendations is that \\u003Cem\\u003E“individuals with a mental health condition should only be detained under very exceptional circumstances.” \\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAccording to both applications of the MQLD (see our reports for \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/finalmqld.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E2012\\u003C/a\\u003E and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MQLD.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E2015\\u003C/a\\u003E), 80% of those we surveyed in detention are clinically depressed. The release of all individuals other than the ones who meet the threshold of ‘exceptional circumstances’ would do a lot to close many facilities down. Likewise, the committee’s recommendation that women who have been victims of sexual assault and rape should not be detained, would all but empty Yarl’s Wood.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne consequence of not entertaining the possibility of abolishing immigration detention, however, is that the panel moves us no further along in thinking about the purpose of these centers. That is to say, there is still no principled discussion of the removal of liberty on the basis of immigration status, nor of its purpose and effect. It’s here that the absence of engagement with academic literature is particularly regrettable, since despite the panel’s claims that they don’t just wish to ‘tinker’ with the system, the report for the most part does just that, even as it calls for ‘radical’ change.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELimiting detention to 28 days would indeed improve matters. Not only would it reduce the time that currently one third of the population serve, but it would diminish people’s sense of uncertainty and anxiety which we know makes detention particularly painful.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn its own, however, as the committee recognizes, ending indefinite detention is not enough. While their attention was on case management―and here some of their ideas about active engagement from the outset of a person’s immigration case sound particularly promising (although given the appalling treatment of detainees and irregular migrants in the United States and Australia, the committee’s apparent approval of practices in those countries seems perverse and unwise)―there are a number of negative outcomes which would need to be addressed before any time limit was brought in. In particular, the government would need to be very careful about safeguarding conditions in detention and conditions outside.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003ELimiting detention to 28 days would indeed improve matters. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EIn those countries, like France, for instance, which have a strict time limit and abide by it, detention centers are extremely bare. There it’s not a matter of whether or not people can go on Facebook, but in fact whether they ever have a chance to see a lawyer or a nurse, or have anything to do each day at all. There’s generally no regime to speak of, little access to outdoor areas, or variety in their diet. If someone will only be locked up for five to 45 days, then the state has little incentive to address such matters. As a result, their focus is purely on security and bureaucracy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThose who are released are often just sent out the door. They can, after all, be detained again if necessary. There are usually insufficient funds to house or assist them, so people are effectively thrown out onto the street. A visit to most European cities at present reveals considerable populations of irregular migrants living rough and engaging in irregular work in which they are highly vulnerable.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EIt’s not a matter of whether or not people can go on Facebook, but whether they ever have a chance to see a lawyer or a nurse, or have anything to do each day at all. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EJust as the ‘end to child detention’ in the UK brought with it new sorrows―children separated from their mothers, placed in care and reunited at the airport―so too a time limit is likely to bring attendant risks. This does not mean the time limit is not the right thing to do. However, if, as the report suggests, there are so many groups for whom detention is inappropriate, then why not do away with this form of confinement altogether?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, the panel does suggest ‘alternatives,’ although it’s not entirely clear what they have in mind. Sweden, they say, does alternatives well, which is probably as we would expect, given their record in other areas from prisons to hospitals. It’s possible to overstate Scandinavian exceptionalism and generosity. As \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/GlobalMobility2012.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EVanessa Barker has shown in her work\\u003C/a\\u003E, Sweden has in fact been extremely punitive and exclusionary to some migrants. Yet it’s hard to imagine how, in an era of austerity, the UK could aspire to anything like the systems Sweden operates.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMoreover, ‘alternatives’ elsewhere have tended to exist alongside carceral projects without disrupting them. In Sweden too, the report says, the numbers in detention remain stable;  alternatives have not replaced custody. It would be worth asking whether they have merely brought others into the purview of state control. How would the UK avoid what Stan Cohen referred to as ‘net widening’ and ‘mesh thinning’?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe report states that in the UK 60,000 individuals are currently reporting. This is already an onerous form of state surveillance for those with no right to paid work. Trekking to the police station each week or month can be logistically very difficult. It too generates considerable anxiety and uncertainty. Would more people be incorporated into other alternatives? Given the current anti-immigrant sentiment, how likely is it that alternatives would avoid feeling and being at least partly punitive?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EIn the UK, 60,000 immigrants are currently reporting.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EFinally, it’s not just in the alternatives, but also healthcare, access to legal advice and treatment for mental health that a number of the issues identified as problematic in detention stem from the wide range of cuts brought in under the last five years of coalition rule.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt may seem churlish or even unwise to criticise the report on these bases. And to be sure it’s a welcome development that Ministers have come together with NGOs, and current and former detainees to produce this document. It is indeed to be hoped that whoever takes power in May 2015 will scrutinize the system of custody that exists to hold people purely because of their citizenship.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI think there’s considerable appetite within the detention estate to do things otherwise. Many of the issues identified in this report are also criticized by some Home Office and custodial staff. Significant aspects of the current system are a result of politics at the highest of levels. Others connect, as was made clear recently on Channel 4, to wider issues of gender and race, and to the insidious effects of criminalization and securitization of migration that academics have been writing about for some time (see, for example, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://bordercriminologies.law.ox.ac.uk/reseach/publications/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Epublications by Border Criminologies researchers\\u003C/a\\u003E).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s evidently out of step with the rest of Europe that Britain fails to observe a time limit.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s also indefensible that those held in custody don’t have their cases regularly reviewed by the courts. Medical and other care needs improvement. The point is that the matters raised in this report, alongside all of the recent media and NGO accounts, raise urgent questions about not just how long people should be detained or under what circumstances, but whether the system should exist at all. The question that remains is how to start having that conversation?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your thoughts at \\u003Ca href=\\\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\\\"\\u003Eideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=356032\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/356032/the-uk-needs-to-stop-indefinitely-detaining-immigrants/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-03-05T05:00:46-05:00\",\"category\":\"Borders\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=356032\",\"dc_creator\":\"Mary Bosworth\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/immigration-detention.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Yarl\\u0026#039;s Wood Immigration Removal Centre, Europe\\u0026#039;s largest detention centre for illegal immigrants, in Bedford, UK.\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/immigration-detention.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/356032/the-uk-needs-to-stop-indefinitely-detaining-immigrants/"], ["published_at", Thu, 05 Mar 2015 10:00:46 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The UK needs to stop indefinitely detaining immigrants"], ["updated_at", Thu, 05 Mar 2015 14:05:09 UTC +00:00]]

Boys are more assured in their math and science abilities, while girls are more anxious about math (the survey did not ask about science anxiety)—even for boys and girls who had equally high scores, Andreas Schleicher, OECD\\u0026#8217;s director for education and skills, told Quartz.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe confidence that boys have may be a result of their parents\\u0026#8217; expectations.

He writes:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EBecause the only thing worse than a market with collapsing valuations is a market with no valuations and no liquidity. If stock in a company is worth what somebody will pay for it, what is the stock of a company worth when there is no place to sell it ?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHere\\u0026#8217;s some explanation: Almost everyone (including Cuban) agrees that if there is a tech bubble today, the risk is concentrated in the hands of private market investors, rather than stock market investors, as was the case in 2000. That\\u0026#8217;s because startups and other privately held companies are waiting much longer to go public now.

He argues that there are thousands (225,000 to be precise) of angel investors in the US that have invested significant amounts of money in private startups—and \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.investor.gov/news-alerts/investor-bulletins/investor-bulletin-accredited-investors\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Enot all of them\\u003C/a\\u003E are necessarily hugely rich people who can swallow their losses. \\u0026#8220;Like the crazy days of the internet boom,  I wonder how many realize what they have gotten into?\\u0026#8221;, he writes.  Many ordinary people could be exposed through equity crowdfunding platforms, which require as little as a $5,000 investment, he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECuban has \\u0026#8220;absolutely\\u0026#8221; no doubt that most of these investors are underwater (i.e their investments are worth less than what they paid for them). Because the market for small tech IPOs has dried up, they have no way to exit their investments. Which could be a problem\\u0026#8221;for all those widows and orphans who will put their $5k into the dream only to realize they can’t get any cash back when they need money to fix their car \\u0026#8221; he writes.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt is an interesting argument. If he is right, it is not entirely clear how this dynamic would flow back to the stock market, where prominent tech companies such as Apple and Google are \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.investor.gov/news-alerts/investor-bulletins/investor-bulletin-accredited-investors\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Earguably undervalued\\u003C/a\\u003E using traditional measures.

It has also shown preview glimpses of several apps, ranging from maps and directions to a remote control for music. Apple Pay, the company\\u0026#8217;s mobile payments product, will also be part of the watch.

Apple sells many of its iPhones, for example, through mobile operator partners and their stores. It makes sense to sell at least some basic watch models via retail partners, even at big box stores such as Walmart.

But it will certainly play a role in the watch\\u0026#8217;s success.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/237085/apple-iwatch-clues-in-steve-jobs-era-apple-wearables/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Enot Apple\\u0026#8217;s first wearable\\u003C/a\\u003E gadget, but it is the company\\u0026#8217;s first fashion item. And Apple is treating this launch differently than its releases of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. For starters, Apple has already run \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/apple-watch-gets-its-first-advertising-stylish-12-page-spread-vogue-163155\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E12 pages of ads in Vogue\\u003C/a\\u003E, the world\\u0026#8217;s top fashion magazine. It held VIP events for influencers at Paris Fashion Week last fall. It brought in a bunch of actual celebrities to last year\\u0026#8217;s big keynote. While Apple has long seeded its products in Hollywood—the company \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.macrumors.com/2014/05/02/apple-buzz-marketing-manager/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ecalls it “buzz marketing”\\u003C/a\\u003E—you can imagine there will also be more high-profile Apple Watch placements over the next few months.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://instagram.com/p/zpzkxjm84B/\\\" title=\\\"View on Instagram\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://instagr.am/p/am.com/media/?size=l\\\" alt=\\\"Instagram Photo\\\" /\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHere\\u0026#8217;s the thing: The iPhone didn\\u0026#8217;t become cool or the world\\u0026#8217;s best-selling phone because it was in Vogue or because celebrities used it. Nor did the iPod, or the iPad, or the Mac. They became cool because they were useful, well-designed, and elegant. But mostly useful. (Similarly, tie-ins with the fashion industry didn\\u0026#8217;t come close to saving Google Glass.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s fine for Apple to advertise the watch in Vogue—why not? That cool factor, if Apple can attain it, could probably move a bunch of units, especially this first version. But the watch\\u0026#8217;s long-term success will depend on its utility \\u003Cem\\u003Eand\\u003C/em\\u003E style—not just one or the other.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch3\\u003ERead this next: \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/319703/2015-is-the-year-of-the-apple-watch/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E2015 is the year of the Apple Watch\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/h3\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=356577\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/356577/the-apple-watch-what-we-dont-know-2/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-03-05T10:37:51-05:00\",\"category\":\"Internet of Everything\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=356577\",\"dc_creator\":\"Dan Frommer\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/apple-watch-photographer.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"apple-watch-photographer\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/apple-watch-photographer.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/356577/the-apple-watch-what-we-dont-know-2/"], ["published_at", Thu, 05 Mar 2015 15:37:51 UTC +00:00], ["title", "The Apple Watch: What we don&#8217;t know"], ["updated_at", Thu, 05 Mar 2015 17:08:08 UTC +00:00]]

Technical knowledge is not keeping pace with economic growth, and business leaders in Africa regularly complain about the lack of local candidates with technical skills. In fact, the most recent ‘\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2015/overview.html\\\"\\u003EAnnual Global CEO survey\\u003C/a\\u003E’ found 90% of CEOS in Africa are highly concerned about the low availability of key competences.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe problem is not just a lack of skills, but a lack of \\u003Cem\\u003Eappropriate \\u003C/em\\u003Eskills. Employers surveyed across 36 African nations as part of the African Economic Outlook pointed to the mismatch in technical and industry relevant skills being more important than the lack of skills overall.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETake the agriculture sector, arguably Africa’s most important industry. Currently the sector contributes 13% of the continent’s GDP, yet only 2% of African students study it at university. This is actually the same amount as in Europe, where agriculture contributes a little over 1% to the GDP of its nations. Most worryingly, Africa owns 60% of the world\\u0026#8217;s uncultivated land suited for crops, but doesn’t have the scientific knowledge to make the most of it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhy does this happen? For decades, major international \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.scidev.net/global/education/feature/higher-education-africa-key-resources.html\\\"\\u003Edonors and policymakers have prioritized primary and secondary education\\u003C/a\\u003E, which has distracted from investment in tertiary education in some African countries. Providing higher education in technical fields can be far more expensive than the social sciences, forcing increasingly cash-strapped public education institutions to cut expansion in these areas. At the same time, businesses have often focused on short-term gains and considered investing in technical and scientific skills too time consuming.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAll of this has created a higher education system that is not geared to local industry, but instead to producing public sector managers. ‘Today\\u0026#8217;s African universities are factories that churn out civil servants’, says Harvard’s Prof Calestous Juma.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut now the private sector in Africa is now in a position to change this. As the leading source of job creation, the private sector should help African countries create high calibre STEM graduates and researchers. They should partner with local universities to improve the quality of STEM curricula. Businesses could help overburdened faculties design courses that equip graduates with both a deep understanding of science and technology as well as practical workplace skills. What’s more, private companies can use their financial resources to help universities provide physical resources to deliver this training. This would allow \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.devex.com/news/the-business-perspective-to-addressing-africa-s-skills-gap-84601\\\"\\u003Ecompanies to reduce the risk and costs of investing in workforce training\\u003C/a\\u003E, as well as assist universities to market themselves as destinations for job-hungry students.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBusinesses should further provide talented young scientists with financial assistance so that they can pursue postgraduate and postdoctoral training in African universities, by increasing industry focused scholarships and placements. Major global players including IBM are doing so with its \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/africa.shtml\\\"\\u003EIBM-Research\\u003C/a\\u003E in Kenya, which has established a new resident scientist program for schools in Kenya and other African countries. The applicants are leading scientists and researchers from pre and post-doctoral backgrounds, as well as from academia, government, or industry, and work with IBM researchers in the physical lab environment. Such initiatives allow private companies to build a pipeline of skilled local talent and incentivize the best and the brightest to stay on the continent.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfrica’s private sector could look to the most innovative international models for inspiration, too. Professor Juma \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/3153/redesigning_african_economies.html\\\"\\u003Ehas encouraged African countries to consider the example of South Korea’s Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH).\\u003C/a\\u003E POSTECH was actually the brain child of Professor Hogil Kim, the founding president of the university and Tae-Joon Park, chair of the Pohang Iron and Steel Company (POSCO), a private company. While POSCO’s initial goal was to train world-class engineers for its own operations, POSTECH now has a major role in educational reform in Korea and is recognized as a leader in science and engineering education in Asia.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGiven the 11 million young Africans expected to enter the job market each year for the next decade, businesses can have all the scientists, engineers and technicians they need on their doorstep. But only if they properly work with and invest in the institutions that train them.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=356740\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/356740/how-private-companies-can-help-african-universities-produce-fewer-civil-servants-but-more-scientists/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-03-05T13:25:43-05:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=356740\",\"dc_creator\":\"Dr. Álvaro Sobrinho\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/rtr3b0rk.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"A girl looks on as she attends her graduation ceremony, along with 600 other students of SIMAD University, in Mogadishu\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/rtr3b0rk.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/356740/how-private-companies-can-help-african-universities-produce-fewer-civil-servants-but-more-scientists/"], ["published_at", Thu, 05 Mar 2015 18:25:43 UTC +00:00], ["title", "How private companies can help African universities produce fewer civil servants but more scientists"], ["updated_at", Thu, 05 Mar 2015 18:55:27 UTC +00:00]]
